## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate the frontend implementation of an Ecommerce site using modern web development technologies. It leverages React as the primary JavaScript library for building user interfaces, Vite as the development server and bundler, Redux Toolkit for state management, Mantine UI for the UI components, React Icons for iconography, and Sweet Alert for displaying beautiful alerts.

Please note that this project only focuses on the frontend and does not include any backend API integration. It serves as a starting point for developers looking to build an Ecommerce site with a similar tech stack and can be easily extended to incorporate backend functionality.
